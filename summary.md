# Solving bribery in public systems

MACI is trying to solve bribery in public blockcahins. It's not because that people can be bribed, or that people are dishonest, it is because a briber, Bob, can get proof that the person they are bribing, Eve, which allows Bob with confidence to pay Eve for the vote.

E-Voting comes with security risks because it is easily accessible compared to traditional paper voting. However, e-voting is more scallable.

MACI does not promise to solve all voting problems, it only tries to tackle one part of a larger problem.
